<blockquote cite="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Apology_(Plato)/Jowett_translation">
I am wiser than this man, for neither of us really knows anything, but he 
thinks he has some knowledge when he has not, while I have no knowledge and 
I do not think I have. I seem, then, in just this one small thing to be wiser
 than he is, that what I do not know, I do not think I know either.
