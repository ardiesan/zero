# Axioms of Admissibility 

- None but facts having relational probative value are admissible
- All facts having rational probative value are admissible unless 
some specific rule forbids their admission

## Criminal law is simple

Satisfy the conditions, break that down into further evidence.

Worst evidence is testimonial evidence. It has to be backed up by something.


## Evidence Defined

- The means
- sanctioned by [the Rules on Evidence]
- of ascertaining
- in a judicial proceeding
- the truth
- respecting a matter of fact

### Rules on Evidence

- They apply to all forms of judicial proceedings and to administrative 
proceedings where there is no other rule.
- Changes in the rules apply to all pending proceedings.

### The Job

The only job is to document it.

# Documentary and Electronic Evidence

"Everything that you need to prosecute your case is in the devices and in the 
computers of the people that you are apprehending."  Atty. Francis Acero

## Cultural Aspect

Filipinos agreement on matters differ from European and American ways. 
Filipinos have a notion of "Understood" and would constitute agreement. Other cultures
would require items on paper. We are a verbal culture.

What then constituite "paper"?

In the Philippines, a chat can constitute "paper".

# Electronic Data Messages/Document Authentication

## Level Recognition

- And electronic document has the same evidentiary value as a physical document.
- The Electronic document is the equivalent of an original document if
  - it is stored in a computer, original
  - any printout or output readable by sight shown to reflect the data accurately
- A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original unless
  - There is genuin question as to the authenticity of the original
  - It is unject or inequitable

## Authentication

**Manner of Authentication**

- Evidence that been digitally signed by the person purported to have signed the same
- Evidence that other appropriate security procedures or devices as may be authorized by the Supreme Court or by law were applied
- Other evidence showing its integrity and reliability to the satisfaction of the judge

# Evidentiary Weight - Integrity of the System

## Factors for Assessing Evidentiary Weight

- Reliability of the manner in which it was generated, stored, and communicated
- Manner in which originator was identified
- Integrity of the information and communication system
- Familiarity of the witness or person who made the entry into the system
- Nature and quality of the information that went into the system
- Other factors that the court may consider

## Integrity of the Information and Communication System

- Operation of the system in a manner that di not affect the integrity of 
the electronic document, and there are no other grounds to doubt the 
integrity of the information and communication system
- Recorded or stored by a party to the proceedings with adverse interests to
the party using it
- Recorded or stored in the usual and ordinary course of business by a person
not a party to the proceedings or under the control of the party using it


---

# Integrity of the Data

- What is presented, it is what is it.
- At the point of seizure, it should be the same data presented to the court.
  - show the arrest and seizure, not the same permission to examine the contents
  - examination of the contents is left to the forensic specialists


---

# Business Records - Method of Proof


## Hearsay Inapplicable

- Business Records
  - Made near the time of or from transmission or supply of information by a person
    knowledgge thereof
  - Kept in the regular course or conduct of business activity
  - Was the regular practice to make the document or record by electronic means
  - SHown by the testimony of the custodian
- May be overturend by evidence of untrustworthiness of the source of information
or the method or circumstances of the preparation, transmission, or storage.

## Method of Proof

- All matters relating to the admissibility and evidentiary weight of an electronic
document must be established by an affidavit
  - Stating facts of direct personal knowledge of the affiant or based on automatic
    records
  - Must show the competence of the affiant to testify on these matters
- Affiant shall be made to affirm the contents in open court

_Important_: Those screenshots or photos that staff ask in the course of their business are evidence

---

# Audio, Video, and Ephemeral Evidence


## Audio, Photo, and Video

- Audio, photographic, and video evidence of events, acts, or transactions, are admissible.
  - Provided it is shown, presented, or displayed to the court
  - Identified, explained, or authenticated by the person who made the recording or some other
    person competent to testify on the accuracy thereof
- Includes recordings of phone conversations or other ephemeral electronic communication

## Ephemeral Evidence

- Proven by a person who was a party to the same or has personal knowledge
- Other competent evidence may be admitted in the case of absence or unavailability

# Difference of Public Documents and Private Documents

## Public Documents

Documents consisting of entries in public records made in the performance of a duty by a public
officer are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. All other public documents are evidence,
even against a third person, of the fact which gave rise to their execution and of the date of the latter.

- The written official actsm or records of the sovereign authority, official bodies, and tribunals and 
public officers whether of the Philippines of a foreign country.
- Document acknowledged before a notary public except last will and testaments.
- Document that are considered public documents under treaties and conventions which are in force between 
the Philippines and country of source, and
- Public records, kept in the Philippines, of private documents required by law to be entered therein 

## Private Documents

Where a private document is more than thirty (30) years old, is produced from a custody in which it would naturally
be found if genuine, and is unblemised by any alterations or circumstances of suspicion, no other evidence of its
authenticity need be given.

Before any private document offered as authentic is received as evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be
provided by any of the following means:

- By anyone who saw the document executed or written;
- By evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker, or
- By other evidence showing its due execution and authenticity

# General Principles

_Warrants are needed for digital devices_

- Even if incidental to a search, a digital device and/or computer is a separate domain that requires

_Effective Period_

- Cybercrime warrants are valid only for a period of ten days, and may be extended for a further 10 based on justifiable reasons

_Where to Apply_

- The cybercrime courts in Quezon City, City of Manila, Makati City, Pasig City,
Cebu City, Iloilo City, Davao City, and Cagayan de Oro City have nationwide 
jurisdiction and over extraterritorial crimes under the cybercrime law.
- Violations by crimes committed through the use of ICT and punishable by the 
Revised Penal Code (RPC) and other special penal laws are filed with the regular trial courts.

# A Private Document is Everything Else

- Present the people who were there
- How it was recorded, how it was made

# Moving Vehicle Scenario

> When you sieze a digital device after an arrest, ... you will still need a warrant for the contents of the device.
> <br/> 
> The physical device is different from the contents.
> <br/> 
> The rule on exigent circumstances will never apply to the contents of the digital device.
> <br/> 
> The court understands that the device is already with you, therefore, you have time to prepare."
 
To get the contents of a digital device is not simple.

- Chain of Custory
- Non-Repudiation

## Cybercrime Warrant Issues

- Data stored in cloud services/providers.
- "I would assume that that would a Subpoena Duces Tecum (SDT)"
- Most likely will involve Search Warrant for the data itself.

# Preservation of Computer Data

- The integrity of traffic data and subscriber information shall be kept, retained, and preserved by a service provide for a minimum of six (6) months from the
date of receipt of the order from law enforcement authorities requiring the preservation.
- Law enforcement may order a one-time extension for six-months
- Once that evidence is used in a case, the receipt of the service provider of a copy of the transmittal document to the Office of the Prosecutir is deemed a notification
to preserve the data for the duration of the case and/or as ordered by the court.
- The order and its compliance is confidential.

## Tracing Drawbacks/Barriers

### IPv4

IPv4's Network Address Translation (NAT) Session Timeout is the reason for this.

2^32 = 4,294,967,296

### IPv6

In a purely IPv6 stack, NAT is not needed. Every device has its own unique address.

2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456

# Warrant to Disclose Computer Data

- Order to disclose or submit subscriber information, traffic data, or relevant data
within 72 hours from receipt of the order in relation to a valid complaint
- The complaint is officially docketed and assigned for investigation
- The disclosure is necessary and relevant for the purpose of investigation

## Contents of Application

- Probable offense involved
- Relevance and necessity of the computer data or subscriber's information 
sought to be _disclosed_ for the purpose of the investigation
- Names of the individuals or entities whose computer data or subscriber's information
are sought to be _disclosed_, including the names of the individuals or enbtities 
that have control, possession, or access
