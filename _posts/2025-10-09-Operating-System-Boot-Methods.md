# Comparison Table

| Feature | Ventoy (Multiboot USB) | Virtual Machine (VM - VirtualBox, VMWare, QEMU) | Standard Live USB | WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Primary Use Case** | IT Toolkit, Distro Hopping, Installation Media, carrying multiple OS setup files. | Software testing, running unsupported apps, development environments, secure browsing. | One-time OS testing, system rescue, password reset, initial installation. | Linux CLI Development, running Linux server apps, interop with Windows files/apps. | 
| **Concept** | Bootloader that reads ISOs/VHDs directly from a standard file partition. | Emulates a complete computer (CPU, RAM, GPU, Disk) within a host operating system. | Drive is formatted to be a dedicated, single-OS boot partition (usually created with Rufus/Etcher). | Lightweight utility VM managed by Windows, tightly integrated with the Windows kernel via a hypervisor. | 
| **OS Limit / Multi-OS** | **Virtually unlimited.** Supports hundreds of ISOs/VHDs/IMG files on a single drive. | **Unlimited** (limited by host storage). Each OS is a separate virtual disk file. | **One OS** per drive. Requires reformatting the entire drive to switch. | **Unlimited** (limited by host storage). Supports multiple distinct Linux distributions running simultaneously. | 
| **Installation/Setup** | **Easy.** Initial install on the USB is fast. Adding/Removing OS is drag-and-drop. | **Moderate to Complex.** Requires installing virtualization software, then installing the OS inside the VM. | **Easy.** Use a tool (Rufus/Etcher) to "flash" a single ISO. Requires reformatting to change OS. | **Easy.** Enabled via a simple Windows feature and command (`wsl --install`). Distros installed via Windows Store/CLI. | 
| **OS Persistence (Saving Data/Settings)** | **Optional/Moderate.** Requires creating and configuring separate persistence `.dat` files for each Linux distro. | **Full Persistence.** Changes are saved automatically to the virtual hard disk file on the host machine. | **Typically None.** Changes are lost on reboot (unless specifically configured during creation). | **Full Persistence.** Changes are saved automatically within the virtual disk image (`.vhdx`) on the Windows filesystem. | 
| **Hardware Access** | **Direct/Native.** Runs directly on the physical hardware, utilizing full CPU/GPU performance. | **Virtual/Simulated.** Access is abstracted. No direct GPU access (slow graphics) unless specialized pass-through is set up (advanced). | **Direct/Native.** Runs directly on the physical hardware, utilizing full CPU/GPU performance. | **Hybrid/Simulated.** Virtualized access with near-native CPU performance. Good network integration. Full GUI/GPU access requires extra configuration. | 
| **Performance** | **Excellent.** Near-native speed (limited primarily by USB drive speed). | **Fair to Good.** Always slower than native; performance is heavily limited by the host's resources (CPU cores, RAM allocated). | **Excellent.** Near-native speed (limited primarily by USB drive speed). | **Very Good.** Near-native CPU performance. Fast file access within Linux; slower when accessing Windows files *from* Linux. | 
| **Security / Isolation** | **Low.** Directly accesses the PC's hardware and internal drives. Less isolation from firmware/BIOS. | **High.** The guest OS is fully isolated from the host OS, making it safe for running risky software. | **Low.** Directly accesses the PC's hardware and internal drives. Useful for system recovery, but poses risks if the live OS is compromised. | **Moderate.** Strong process isolation, but relies on the Windows Hyper-V layer and shares the network stack with the host OS. Tighter integration reduces full isolation. | 
| **Portability** | **High.** A single, flexible drive you can carry and boot on almost any modern PC (UEFI/Legacy support). | **Low.** Requires the host PC to have virtualization software installed and sufficient resources to run the VM. | **High.** A single drive you can boot on almost any PC. | **Low.** Entirely reliant on a Windows Host machine. Cannot be moved to another machine easily without exporting/imporing the VHDX file. | 

# Summary of Key Differences

* **Ventoy is the "USB Swiss Army Knife"** . It excels at versatility and speed when you need to boot many different things on **bare metal** (the actual computer hardware). It's the best option for IT professionals or hobbyists who need a multi-OS recovery and installation drive.
 Ventoy offers flexible persistence compared to all other setup.

* **A Virtual Machine is the "Software Sandbox."** It is the most secure and persistent method, ideal for running an OS **concurrently** with your primary OS without rebooting, and for environments where security and isolation are paramount.

* **A Standard Live USB is the "Quick Test."** It's the simplest way to get a single OS running on bare metal for a temporary diagnostic or preview session, but it is inflexible for managing multiple systems.

* **WSL2 is the "Developer's Interop Tool."** It provides a nearly native Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) experience seamlessly within Windows, prioritizing speed, development, and system integration over complete hardware isolation.

# Activies

## Activity 1

- [Download Ventoy](https://ventoy.net/en/download.html) and verify the hash of the download.
- Follow the [Get Started](https://ventoy.net/en/doc_start.html) guide on how to use.


## Activity 2

- Download a [Kali Live](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-live) image.
If you have a considerability good sized external storage for your Ventoy, more than 14Gb of storage, download the "Everything" version of the Live Boot image.
- Save it under the `:/ventoy` directory of your drive.
- [Configure Ventoy](https://ventoy.net/en/plugin_entry.html) to only search for images under the `:/ventoy` directory.  

> ##### Tip
